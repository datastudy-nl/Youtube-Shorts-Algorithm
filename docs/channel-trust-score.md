# Channel Authority: The "Trust Score" System

> **Hidden Mechanic:** YouTube assigns a dynamic "Confidence Score" (Trust Rank) to every channel ID. This score determines your **Initial Test Batch Size** and your **Benefit of the Doubt** during metric fluctuations.

## 1. How "Trust" is Calculated

The Trust Score behaves like a Credit Rating.

$$
\text{Trust} = \text{Consistency} \times (\text{Avg VVSA} + \text{Safety History})
$$

### Factors Increasing Trust (+)
*   **Upload Consistency:** Regular inputs (daily/weekly) reduce system uncertainty.
*   **Clean Metadata:** accurate titles, no keyword stuffing.
*   **High "Session Start" Rate:** People specifically search for your channel to watch Shorts.
*   **History:** Age of channel without Community Guidelines strikes.

### Factors Decreasing Trust (-)
*   **Delete & Re-upload:** Major red flag. Looks like "spamming/fishing" for better RNG.
*   **Broken Links / Scam Comments:** If you pin scam comments, trust tanks.
*   **Sudden Niche Pivots:** Gaming channel suddenly posting political clips. (Resets audience confidence).
*   **Copyright Strikes:** The nuclear option. Often caps impressions permanently until expiry.

## 2. The Tiers of Authority

### Tier 1: The "Sandbox" (New Channels)
*   **State:** Unknown. High volatility.
*   **Test Size:** ~0 - 500 views per video.
*   **Goal:** Prove you are human and consistent.
*   **Strategy:** Post high-quality originals. Do not touch "copyright gray areas" yet.

### Tier 2: The "Verified Player" (Growth Phase)
*   **State:** Consistent 10k - 50k views.
*   **Test Size:** 2,000 - 5,000 views guaranteed (The "Floor").
*   **Privilege:** One "Bad" video doesn't kill the channel momentum.
*   **Strategy:** Experiment with formats. You have a safety net.

### Tier 3: The "Partner" (Viral Authority)
*   **State:** 1M+ views regularly.
*   **Test Size:** 100k+ views guaranteed.
*   **Privilege:** The algorithm *assumes* your content is good before testing. You get "Pre-notification" reach.
*   **Risk:** High scrutiny on monetization/safety.

## 3. "Shadowbans" vs. Low Trust

Creators often confuse "Low Trust" with "Shadowbans".

| Symptom | Diagnosis | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0 Views (Hard)** | Shadowban / Filter | Check copyright, stop posting for 48h. |
| **1-5 Views** | Indexing Delay | Wait. System is slow. |
| **~400 Views & Stop** | Failed Wave 1 | Your content failed the seed test. Improve hook. |
| **Views dropped from 10k to 100** | Trust Crash (Re-classification) | Did you change topic? Did you re-upload? Just keep posting quality to rebuild credit. |

## 4. Recovering a "Dead" Channel

If you have ruined your Trust Score (e.g., bought subs, spam posted, massive niche pivots), you have two options:

### Option A: The Rehab (Slow)
1.  **Stop** all "hacky" behaviors.
2.  Post **1** high-quality Short per day.
3.  Ignore metrics for 30 days.
4.  The system will eventually re-calibrate (approx 20-30 uploads).

### Option B: The Phoenix (Fast)
1.  Create a fresh channel (New Gmail).
2.  Upload your best backlog content (watermark free).
3.  **Why?** New channels get "Newbie Boost" (Exploration phase). If your content is actually good, a new channel might skyrocket faster than a ruined old one.

**Rule of Thumb:** If you have <1,000 subs and the channel is dead, start over. If >10k subs, rehabilitate.
